# Jeanette Rivera - Juan Juanson Notes

---

**Directions:**

1 - Anytime you see code, follow along in terminal.

2 - Create a cheatsheet from Lesson Objectives and submit github link of file to slack when done.

3 - Notify Liza via slack when done so you can get the lab.

**Lesson Objectives:**

- Explain the relationship between `.new()` and `def initialize()`.
  - `.new()` is used to instantiate (create) a new instance of a class.
  - `def initialize()` (the initialize method), is a method that is carried out (runs) automatically when a new instance of a class is instantiated (.new() is used)


- Define class, subclass, instance, and self.
  - **class** is like an object blueprint. It holds all the default attributes (traits) and methods (things it does) of an object (the structure/layout).
  - **sub class** a class that inherits all attributes and methods from the parent class (use < to denote inheritance)
  - **instance** is an instance of a class (a customized duplicate of a class)
  - **self** an instance's way of referring to itself


- Properly define `instance` and `class` variables.
  - `instance variables` are denoted by the @ symbol, only available to that instance you created.

  - `class variables` 


- Properly define `instance` and `class` methods.
  - `instance methods` are methods called on the instance.

  - `class methods`

- Distinguish whether a piece of data is best suited to being stored in a local, instance, or class variable.


- Describe the relationship of `attr_` and "getter" and "setter" methods.


- Distinguish whether a piece of data is best suited to having its accessibility defined by attr_reader, attr_writer, attr_accessor or none of the above.
